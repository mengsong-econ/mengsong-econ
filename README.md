## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Meng Song**. I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at the University of Connecticut. My primary research interests are applied microeconomics with a focus on labor economics, health economics, and the economics of education.

Alongside my doctoral studies, I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science, where I am honing my skills in Natural Language Processing and empirical Machine Learning methods. I apply these tools to extract meaningful insights from various data sources, thereby improving the precision and impact of my research findings.

Feel free to explore my repositories and projects. Contributions and collaborations are always welcome!
